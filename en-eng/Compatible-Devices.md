## GLEDOPTO

Please do not that it seems that GLEDOPTO do not provide LQI information, and due to that would probably behave as a very bad router. Controller and other routers won't have any clue on the LQI quality they have with such devices.

## Philips

* Philips bulbs don't have Configure Reporting working. Due to that and in order to get their states (if you can comman dthe Bulb outside of Domoticz , like with a remote), you must set a regular polling. So you MUST enable 'enableReadAttributes' parameter.
So there is a risk of latency when using Remote or Group command between the command and geting the status reflected on Domoticz (as it is based on the polling frequency)
