# Network Energy levels

Starting Plugin Version: > 4.4, the plugin queries Zigate to get informations on the Energy level per channel.

In the 10 first minutes after plugin start, a Network Energy Level scan will be executed.

The Energy-Level measurement is a value from 0 to 255 given for all Zigate supported channels ( 11, 15, 19, 20, 25 and 26). 
It is given in an arbitrary units (didn't find any more information in the NXP Zigbee documentation).

* Tx (Total Transmission) is the total number of transmissions (from other networks) detected during the scan
* Failure (Transmission Failure) is the number of failed transmissions detected during the scan
* Energy-Level measurement reports energy-level measurements (the value 255 indicates there is too much interferences on the channel).

In short, higher the value is , indicates a high interferences, worst it is. Better to select an other channel with lower level.
