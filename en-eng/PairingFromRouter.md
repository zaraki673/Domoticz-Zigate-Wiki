# Pairing from a specific Router

## Introduction

You might want to force the pairing of a specific end device to a dedicated router instead of leaving the Controler to decided.
Despite the fact that the pairing will be done to a specific router, the system can then later decide to change the route and
you/we don't have any control to that.


## What to do

1. Make sure the Zigate is not in pairing mode, if yes, Stop it

1. From the Plugin Web User Interface

1. Click on the __Provisionning__ menu
1. In the _Accept new Hardware on router__ select from the List the router you want to use
1. Enable the Pairing for 4 minutes
  
__Attention__

It may happen that after pairing a device the all routers switches to pairing mode. If you want to continue pairing only from that specific device, you need to redo the all cycle
