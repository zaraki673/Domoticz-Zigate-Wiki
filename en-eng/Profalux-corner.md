# Purpose is to document all findings around Profalux Zigbee blind/shutter


## Pairing Process

The pairing process is well documented on [Zigate.fr]( https://zigate.fr/2018/02/03/association-des-volets-profalux-a-la-zigate/ )

1. Reset of Shutter and Remote command

   1. Check that Zigate is not in pairing mode.
   1. 5 times on R (back side of remote)
   
   Remote will flash RED then GREEN
   
   1. In the next minute press STOP
   
   You can check that the remote command the shutter. In case not, please consult the Profalux documentation
   
1. Pairing of Shutter
   1. Switch Zigate to pairing mode ( Permit to Join, or use the Provisionning function from Web Admin)
   1. Press once on R (back side of remote)
   1. Press UP
   
   The shutter should go up-down
   
   1. When the remote Led do not flash anymore press STOP
   
## Findings

* Manufacturer Code: 0x1110
* ProfileID: 0x0104
* DeviceID: 0x0200 ( Shutter )
* DeviceID: 0x0201 ( remote 

Profalux do not use attribut 0x0005 __Model Name__ of Basic cluster.
Attribut 0x0010 of Basic Cluster should provide Type of device ( 'bso', volet' )


When you don't have any controler, one of the shutter act as a controler

Interestingly, you can move the network from one Channel to an other one via the ZOE Admin menu

## VR

* Remote Control

```
ProfileID 0104
ZDeviceID 0201
Application Version 0000
Cluster IN Count: 03
Cluster In 1: 0000 (Basic)
Cluster In 2: 0003 (Identify)
Cluster In 3: 0015 (Commissioning)
Cluster OUT Count: 08
Cluster Out 1: 0003 (Identify)
Cluster Out 2: 0004 (Groups)
Cluster Out 3: 0005 (Scenes)
Cluster Out 4: 0006 (On/Off)
Cluster Out 5: 0008 (Level Control)
Cluster Out 6: 0100 (Shade Configuration)
Cluster Out 7: fc20
Cluster Out 8: fc21

```

## Store


## Steering and other findings

* The Profalux shutter can be steer with cluster ONOFF (0x0006) or cluster LevelControl (0x0008). It is __adviced__ to use __only__ the LevelControl even for a full Open or Close.

* Configure Reporting can be set on Cluster LevelControl (0x0008) attribute (0x0000)

The remote is very basic and it is not adviced to try doing anything with it. During the pairing process, the Shutter and the Remote will announced themselve, just drop the remote, but keep it paired on Zigate as both VR and Remote must be part of the same network.

* If you have a ZOE central remote, you can create groups, and those groupes are created in the range of 0x8000 - 0x8... ) Otherwise , Profalux informed me that depending on the Firmware version of Zoe, they must be pgraded before been paired with a non-Profalux controler. For that the best is to contact Profalux for getting the upgrade.
